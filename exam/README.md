A 

Multiplying Eq. 3.29 in the Lecture Notes with product from k=1 to n (d_k - lambda) leads to an equivalent polynomial equation of the order m which has exactly n roots.

pi_{i = 1}^{n} (d_i - lambda) * (- (d_p - lambda) + sum_{k != p}^n (u_k^2 / (d_k - lambda))) = 0
- (d_p - lambda) * pi_{i = 1}^{n} (d_i - lambda) + sum_{k != p)^n (u_k^2) pi_{i = 1}^{n} (d_i - lambda) = 0
