Testing the quasi-Newton method with Broydens update
Check part A
Minimize the Rosenbrock valley function
f(x, y) = (1 - x)^2 + 100 * (y - x^2)^2
Starting point: x0 =
 [-2.  2.]
f(x0) =
 409.0
The minimum is found as:
[ 1.  1.]
f(min) =
 4.97968446421e-30
Number of steps used: 109
We can now compare the number of steps used by different methods
Number of steps used in the Newton minimization (A) is 26
Number of steps used in the Newton root-finding is 523
Number of steps using Newton root-finding with the Jacobian is 523



Check part B
Minimize the Himmelblau function
f(x, y) = (x^2 + y -11)^2 + (x + y^2 - 7)^2
Starting point: x0 =
 [ 2.5  2. ]
f(x0) =
 7.8125
The minimum is found as:
[ 3.  2.]
f(min) =
 1.95159139242e-24
Number of steps used: 9



We can now compare the number of steps used by different methods
Number of steps used in the Newton minimization (A) is 5
Number of steps used in the Newton root-finding is 5
Number of steps using Newton root-finding with the Jacobian is 5
