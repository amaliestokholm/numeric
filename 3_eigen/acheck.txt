Testing Jacobi diagonalization
A = 
 [[1 1]
 [1 0]]

Number of rotations used = 3

Eigenvalues of A are:
e =
 [[-0.61803399]
 [ 1.61803399]]

Eigenvectors of A are:
V =
 [[ 0.52573111  0.85065081]
 [-0.85065081  0.52573111]]

A after the diagonalization is:
A =
 [[1 0]
 [1 0]]

Are V.T A V = e?
True

Are the eigenvalues identical to the ones found using np.linalg?
True
